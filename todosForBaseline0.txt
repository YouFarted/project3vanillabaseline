The goal for this stage is to have this project include placeholder tests
and connect to a backend sequelize database that links for mysql
such that I can begin to construct a TypeScript project that mirrors its
layout and beginning functionality.
These pieces aren't done yet but I have the barebone structure from which I
can work to add the above.
