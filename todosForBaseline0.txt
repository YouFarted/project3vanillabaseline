The goal for this stage is to have this project 
connect to a backend mysql sequelize database that connects
such that I can begin to construct a TypeScript project that mirrors its
layout and beginning functionality.
DONE.  Now on to the test this with Heroku so I can continue to port
this to Typescript and add simple tests for a legitimate project baseline
I will consider this project done once it has been verified 
to work on Heroku
